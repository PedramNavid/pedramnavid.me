I'm a data scientist with experience on modeling, analysis, visualization,
deployment to production, tooling, and education. 

I'm interested in statistics, machine learning, programming in R, Shiny & Python,
as well as developing R packages, and other tooling to make the lives of data
scientists easier.

I also like to fly planes, ride motorcycles, and go camping.

I currently live in San Francisco, after 30 or so years of living in Toronto. 

### Recent Work

* [trump-scraper](https://github.com/PedramNavid/trump_speeches): a Python script
that scrapes 55 of Donald Trump's speeches prior to his presidency. Used by
David Robinson from Stack Overflow, among others, for analysis. I also used this
data to create a Trump Speech Generator using a Recursive Neural Network.
* [TTC-Aliens](https://github.com/PedramNavid/TTC-Aliens): Python package that
randomly replaces the occasional tweet from the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC)
with warnings about incoming aliens.
* [GooeyPi](https://github.com/PedramNavid/GooeyPi): Cross-platform wxPython
front-end to PyInstaller.
