# Hi there

Hi, my name is Pedram and this is my personal blog. It uses the 
[Terminal](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-terminal/) theme,
and is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.com) and Netlify.

I walk the boundary between data science and data engineer, and spend a lot
of time thinking about to make others more effective. 

If you need to reach out, you can find me at pedram.navid@gmail.com
