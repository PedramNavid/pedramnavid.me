      <description>Finding a way to get models into production seems like a universal problem these days. 1.75 billion results as of last count, with countless companies devoted to solving this in one way or another.
The Problem At Windfall, we used a variety of models built by data scientists to drive our products. The problem was that different people had slightly different ways of building them, and so there was no standard way of running them.
We relied heavily on whoever built the model in order to run it whenever we needed predictions. We also were exploring tying in model predictions directly into our front-end systems.</description>
