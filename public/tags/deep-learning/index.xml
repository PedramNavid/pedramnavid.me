      <description>With Trump&amp;rsquo;s victory, I thought it would be interesting to scope out some Trump-related datasets and get some practice with different machine learning algorithms. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen some work with generative text with Markov Chains, but thought a Recurrent Neural Network might be a little more fun to play with.
Web Scraping Grabbing a large enough dataset was the first problem to solve. I did find a Github that had some Trump speeches but the data was 3 months old as of this post. I decided instead to create a simple scraper to capture all 55 of his speeches from The American Presidency Project.</description>
