      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking to revisit my baby name analysis and wanted to play around a bit more with Shiny, and finally found the time to do it.
The site is up on Shinyapps: https://pedramnavid.shinyapps.io/shinybabies/
Essentially, it looks at the trend in baby names by gender in Ontario, Canada. There are three views, the first looks at the changing trend in suffixes, the second explores uniqueness, and the last looks at gender-neutrality.
Each section has a brief description of what the analysis is showing, so it should be fairly standalone. Hope you find it interesting.</description>
